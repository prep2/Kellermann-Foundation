## Project Description

This project focuses on development of a web application to be used by the maternity ward which will allow for nurses in the ward to effectively enter patient data on one system, dissolving their current pen-and-paper system of recording patient information.

## Members of this Project

- Khoa Nguyen - Biology
- Jorge Gonzalez - Software Engineering
- Afsar Thalakola - Computer Science
- Aishani De Sirkar - Computer Science

## Impact

The web application will allow for efficient monotiring and care of mothers and their new babies during their stay at the ward. Overall, the staff and healthcare providers present in the hosiptal will benefit from the information on a singular and easy-to-use platform for monitoring patient health and and health history.
